# Prompt Engineering Accelerator — Hands-On Labs

## How to Use These Labs

Each lab is designed to take 10-12 minutes using any free AI chat interface (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, or a local model via Ollama). You'll paste prompts, observe results, iterate, and compare. No coding required.

**Setup**: Open your preferred AI chat interface in a browser tab. Start a new conversation for each lab.

---

## Lab 1: Strengthen Weak Prompts (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Apply the 6 building blocks (Task, Context, Role, Format, Examples, Constraints) to transform vague prompts into structured, measurable ones.

**What you'll learn**: How adding each element systematically improves output quality, consistency, and usefulness.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Establish a baseline.** Paste this vague prompt into your AI chat and note the response:

```
Explain cloud computing.
```

Observe: How long is the response? Is it useful for any specific audience? Could you predict what format you'd get?

**Step 2 — Add a Task definition.** Now try:

```
Task: Explain the three main service models of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
```

Compare: Is the output more focused? Does it cover what you expected?

**Step 3 — Add Context and Audience.** Build on the prompt:

```
Task: Explain the three main service models of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
Context: The audience is a group of small business owners evaluating whether to migrate from on-premises servers. They have no technical background.
```

Compare: Has the language changed? Are the explanations more relevant to the audience?

**Step 4 — Add a Role.** Add a persona:

```
Role: You are a cloud computing consultant who specializes in helping small businesses migrate to the cloud. You explain technical concepts using everyday business analogies.

Task: Explain the three main service models of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
Context: The audience is a group of small business owners evaluating whether to migrate from on-premises servers. They have no technical background.
```

Compare: Do you notice analogies or a different communication style?

**Step 5 — Add Format requirements.** Specify the output structure:

```
Role: You are a cloud computing consultant who specializes in helping small businesses migrate to the cloud. You explain technical concepts using everyday business analogies.

Task: Explain the three main service models of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
Context: The audience is a group of small business owners evaluating whether to migrate from on-premises servers. They have no technical background.

Format: For each service model, provide:
- Name and one-sentence definition
- A real-world business analogy
- One example use case for a small business
- Estimated monthly cost range

Present as a comparison table.
```

Compare: Is the output now consistently structured and easy to scan?

**Step 6 — Add Constraints.** Add boundaries:

```
Role: You are a cloud computing consultant who specializes in helping small businesses migrate to the cloud. You explain technical concepts using everyday business analogies.

Task: Explain the three main service models of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
Context: The audience is a group of small business owners evaluating whether to migrate from on-premises servers. They have no technical background.

Format: For each service model, provide:
- Name and one-sentence definition
- A real-world business analogy
- One example use case for a small business
- Estimated monthly cost range

Present as a comparison table.

Constraints:
- No jargon without immediate explanation
- Keep total response under 300 words
- End with a one-sentence recommendation for a typical 10-person office
```

**Step 7 — Run the final prompt 3 times.** Paste the complete prompt from Step 6 three separate times (in new conversations or after clearing context). Compare the three outputs:
- Do they all follow the table format?
- Are the analogies consistent in quality?
- Does the recommendation stay relevant?

This is measuring **consistency** — a key quality metric.

**Step 8 — Reflect.** Rate each version (Steps 1-6) on a 1-5 scale for: specificity, usefulness, and consistency. Note which building block made the biggest difference for this task.

## Lab 2: Few-Shot & Chain of Thought Comparison (12 minutes)

**Goal**: Compare zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on a classification task where the "correct" answer depends on company-specific rules that the AI can't infer on its own.

**What you'll learn**: When accuracy problems are caused by missing domain knowledge (not sloppy reasoning), few-shot examples fix the gap while CoT only makes the wrong reasoning visible — a useful distinction for choosing the right technique.

**Scenario**: You work at a growth-stage SaaS company that just raised Series B. The company has unusual but defensible priority rules driven by its current business strategy — and several of these rules *contradict* standard industry practice.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Predict, then test.** Read this ticket carefully:

> "Hey, just wanted to let you know that Competitor X released a feature similar to your dashboard. I'm still happy with your product, but thought you'd want to know!"

**Before pasting anything**, write down: what priority would you assign (P1-Critical, P2-High, P3-Medium, P4-Low)? And what priority do you think the AI will assign?

Now test your prediction:

```
You are a support ticket classifier. Assign exactly one priority level to the following support ticket: P1-Critical, P2-High, P3-Medium, or P4-Low.

Ticket: "Hey, just wanted to let you know that Competitor X released a feature similar to your dashboard. I'm still happy with your product, but thought you'd want to know!"
```

Were you right about the AI's answer? This seems low-priority — the customer is happy and just sharing info. But at this company, **any mention of a competitor is an immediate P1 churn signal**, because reducing churn is the board's #1 metric post-Series B.

**Step 2 — Batch classify.** Now test all 5 tickets at once to build a zero-shot baseline:

```
You are a support ticket classifier. Assign exactly one priority level to each ticket: P1-Critical, P2-High, P3-Medium, or P4-Low.

Classify each ticket independently. Present results as a table with columns: Ticket #, Short Description, Priority, Reasoning (1 sentence).

Ticket 1: "Hey, just wanted to let you know that Competitor X released a feature similar to your dashboard. I'm still happy with your product, but thought you'd want to know!"

Ticket 2: "URGENT: I accidentally deleted my project files and I need them back IMMEDIATELY. This is a disaster!"

Ticket 3: "The 'Get Started' button on your pricing page has a weird color glitch on mobile. Just FYI."

Ticket 4: "None of our 25-person team can access the platform since 8 AM. We have client meetings today."

Ticket 5: "I was charged $45 twice this month. Can someone look into this?"
```

Look at the results. The AI will classify based on **general industry norms**. But this company's actual rules are very different.

**Step 3 — Spot the mismatches.** Here is this company's actual priority policy — shaped by their growth strategy:

- **Any mention of a competitor** = always P1, even if the customer sounds happy (churn prevention is the #1 board metric)
- **Data loss for single users** = P3, not P1 (automated backups recover files in 15 minutes — this is routine)
- **UI/cosmetic bugs on public-facing pages** (pricing, signup, landing) = P2 (these pages drive conversion — the growth team's top priority)
- **Service outages affecting teams** = P1 (standard)
- **Billing issues under $100** = P4 (self-service billing portal handles these automatically)

Compare the AI's zero-shot answers to this policy. How many of the 5 tickets did zero-shot get wrong?

**Step 4 — Try CoT without the company rules.** Start a new conversation. This time, give the AI a structured reasoning framework — but do NOT include the company-specific policy. We want to see if better *thinking* alone fixes the errors:

```
You are a support ticket classifier. Assign exactly one priority level to each ticket: P1-Critical, P2-High, P3-Medium, or P4-Low.

For each ticket, reason through these steps BEFORE assigning priority:
1. What is the actual technical or business issue? (Ignore emotional language.)
2. What is the blast radius? (One user, a team, all users, or a potential customer?)
3. Is there data loss, a security risk, or a revenue impact?
4. Does the customer have a workaround?
5. Based on business impact (not tone), assign priority.

Show your full reasoning for each ticket, then present a summary table.

Ticket 1: "Hey, just wanted to let you know that Competitor X released a feature similar to your dashboard. I'm still happy with your product, but thought you'd want to know!"

Ticket 2: "URGENT: I accidentally deleted my project files and I need them back IMMEDIATELY. This is a disaster!"

Ticket 3: "The 'Get Started' button on your pricing page has a weird color glitch on mobile. Just FYI."

Ticket 4: "None of our 25-person team can access the platform since 8 AM. We have client meetings today."

Ticket 5: "I was charged $45 twice this month. Can someone look into this?"
```

Compare to zero-shot. You'll likely find CoT produces **the same classifications** — and that's the key insight. The reasoning is now *visible* (you can read exactly how the AI thought through each ticket), but the answers don't improve. Why? Because the errors aren't caused by sloppy thinking — they're caused by **missing domain knowledge**. The AI reasons perfectly well about blast radius and business impact, but it has no way to know that this company treats competitor mentions as P1 or that single-user data loss is only P3 because of automated backups. CoT makes the reasoning auditable, which is great for debugging — but structured thinking can't substitute for information the model doesn't have.

**Step 5 — Teach the policy with examples.** Now paste this few-shot prompt — it teaches the company's policy through examples, not rules:

```
You are a support ticket classifier for a growth-stage SaaS company. Assign exactly one priority level: P1-Critical, P2-High, P3-Medium, or P4-Low.

Company priority rules (taught by example):

Ticket: "I noticed your competitor just launched a mobile app. I don't need one personally, but just a heads up."
Priority: P1-Critical
(Any mention of a competitor — even casual or positive — is P1. Churn prevention is our top metric.)

Ticket: "Help! I accidentally deleted my entire project folder. I need those files back!"
Priority: P3-Medium
(Single-user data loss is P3. Our automated backup system recovers files in 15 minutes.)

Ticket: "The testimonial carousel on the homepage is overlapping the signup button on tablets."
Priority: P2-High
(UI bugs on public-facing pages like homepage, pricing, or signup are P2 — they affect conversion rates.)

Ticket: "Our whole department of 40 people can't log in since this morning."
Priority: P1-Critical
(Service outages affecting teams are always P1.)

Ticket: "You double-charged me $29 on my last invoice. Please refund."
Priority: P4-Low
(Billing issues under $100 are P4 — our self-service billing portal handles these automatically.)

Ticket: "I just finished a demo of Competitor Y for my team. Still deciding between you two."
Priority: P1-Critical
(Active competitor evaluation = highest churn risk. Always P1 regardless of tone.)

Now classify these 5 tickets. Present as a table with: Ticket #, Short Description, Priority, Reasoning.

Ticket 1: "Hey, just wanted to let you know that Competitor X released a feature similar to your dashboard. I'm still happy with your product, but thought you'd want to know!"

Ticket 2: "URGENT: I accidentally deleted my project files and I need them back IMMEDIATELY. This is a disaster!"

Ticket 3: "The 'Get Started' button on your pricing page has a weird color glitch on mobile. Just FYI."

Ticket 4: "None of our 25-person team can access the platform since 8 AM. We have client meetings today."

Ticket 5: "I was charged $45 twice this month. Can someone look into this?"
```

Compare all three tables. Few-shot should nail all 5 — the examples directly taught the counterintuitive rules that neither zero-shot nor CoT could figure out. This is the payoff: examples don't just improve reasoning, they **transfer knowledge** the model couldn't access otherwise.

**Step 6 — Identify the pattern.** Look at your zero-shot, CoT, and few-shot results together. Notice that zero-shot and CoT likely produced the same classifications — the only difference is CoT shows its work. For each ticket, write down: what reasoning did CoT reveal, and why didn't that reasoning lead to the correct answer? What did the few-shot examples provide that structured thinking alone couldn't?

**Step 7 — Compare results.** Fill in your scorecard:

| Ticket (short) | Zero-Shot | CoT (no rules) | Few-Shot | Company Policy |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Competitor mention (happy) | | | | P1 |
| Deleted files (urgent) | | | | P3 |
| Pricing page glitch (casual) | | | | P2 |
| 25-person outage | | | | P1 |
| $45 double charge | | | | P4 |

You should see: zero-shot (~2/5), CoT (~2/5 — same answers, but with visible reasoning), few-shot (5/5). The takeaway: CoT adds **auditability** (you can see *why* the AI chose each priority), but it doesn't add **accuracy** when the problem is missing domain knowledge. Only few-shot — which transfers the company's actual rules through examples — closes the gap.

**Step 8 (Optional) — Write your own tricky ticket.** Write a support ticket designed to **fool the zero-shot classifier** given this company's unusual rules. Hint: try a ticket where the obvious priority and the company policy priority are as far apart as possible.

**Step 9 (Optional) — Test your adversarial ticket.** Paste your tricky ticket and ask:

```
Classify this ticket using all three approaches (zero-shot, few-shot with the company examples, and CoT with the company-specific reasoning framework). Show each approach's classification side by side.
```

Which technique handled your adversarial ticket best?

**Step 10 — Reflect.** Complete your final comparison:

| Technique | Tickets Correct (out of 5) | Best For |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|
| Zero-shot | ___ | |
| Few-shot | ___ | |
| CoT | ___ | |

Key takeaway: CoT improves *how* the AI reasons but can't teach it rules it doesn't know. Few-shot teaches domain knowledge directly through examples. In production, combine both: few-shot examples to teach the rules, plus CoT to make every decision auditable. The AI "knows" standard industry practices — but it can't know *your* company's unique priorities unless you teach it.

## Lab 3: Production Prompt Engineering (12 minutes)

**Goal**: Build a structured, constrained prompt that produces consistent, machine-parseable JSON output suitable for feeding into a real system.

**What you'll learn**: How to combine schema, role, and constraints to create production-grade prompts — and why each layer solves a different problem.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Start with a loose prompt.** Paste this in your AI chat:

```
Write a product changelog entry for this feature: We added the ability for users to export their dashboard data as a CSV file.
```

Look at what you got. Now imagine you need to feed this into an automated system that:
- Displays it on a release notes page
- Sends notification emails to affected users
- Categorizes it in a searchable changelog database

Could a script extract the feature title, category, affected product area, and whether users need to do anything? The output is human-readable — but it's not machine-parseable. That's the gap this lab addresses.

**Step 2 — Define structured JSON output.** Now specify exactly what you want:

```
Task: Generate a product changelog entry for a software feature.

Output as JSON with exactly this schema:
{
  "title": "Short feature title",
  "type": "feature|improvement|bugfix|breaking_change",
  "description": "One paragraph describing what changed and why",
  "affected_areas": ["list", "of", "product", "areas"],
  "user_action_required": true|false,
  "details": "Technical details or migration steps if needed"
}

Feature: We added the ability for users to export their dashboard data as a CSV file.
```

**Step 3 — Validate the output.** Check the JSON response:
- Is it valid JSON? (Copy it into jsonlint.com or any JSON validator.)
- Does it match the schema exactly?
- Are all fields present with reasonable values?

Compare this to your Step 1 output. The Step 1 prose was human-readable but unparseable. The Step 2 JSON is machine-parseable — a script can extract every field. That's the first layer solved: *structure*.

But look closely at the quality...

**Step 4 — Find what the schema alone doesn't control.** Run the Step 2 prompt for two more features:

```
Feature: We redesigned the notification preferences page so users can choose per-channel settings for email, SMS, and in-app alerts.
```
```
Feature: We fixed a bug where the search bar would return no results if the query contained special characters like & or #.
```

Now compare all three JSON outputs:
- Are the descriptions a consistent length, or is one a sentence and another a full paragraph?
- Are the titles formatted consistently (sentence case? title case? with or without a period?)?
- Is the "details" field useful, or did the model just repeat the description?
- Did the model correctly identify "type" for each? (CSV export = feature, notification redesign = improvement, search fix = bugfix)

The schema controls *structure* but not *quality*. That's what constraints are for.

**Step 5 — Add role and constraints for quality.** Enhance the prompt:

```
Role: You are a technical writer producing changelog entries that will be displayed in the product's release notes page and consumed by an automated notification system. Every entry must follow the exact same format so the system can parse and categorize them.

Task: Generate a product changelog entry.

Output as JSON with exactly this schema:
{
  "title": "Max 10 words, no period, sentence case",
  "type": "feature|improvement|bugfix|breaking_change",
  "description": "Exactly 2-3 sentences. First sentence: what changed. Second sentence: why it matters to the user. Third sentence (optional): any context.",
  "affected_areas": ["1-4 product areas, lowercase, use standard names: dashboard, settings, search, auth, billing, notifications, api, reports"],
  "user_action_required": true|false,
  "details": "If user_action_required is true, specific steps the user must take. If false, set to null."
}

Constraints:
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no explanation before or after
- Title must be under 10 words with no trailing period
- Description must be exactly 2-3 sentences (no more, no less)
- affected_areas must use only the standard area names listed above
- If no user action is required, "details" must be null (not an empty string, not a repeated description)
- type must accurately reflect the change: new capability = feature, enhancement to existing = improvement, fix = bugfix, requires migration = breaking_change

Feature: We added the ability for users to export their dashboard data as a CSV file.
```

**Step 6 — Compare Step 4 vs. Step 5.** Run the constrained prompt for all three features. Now compare against your Step 4 (schema-only) outputs:
- Are titles now consistently under 10 words in sentence case?
- Are descriptions exactly 2-3 sentences every time?
- Is the "details" field null for non-action items (instead of repeating information)?
- Did the constrained version correctly use the standardized area names?

The constraints closed the quality gaps that the schema alone left open.

**Step 7 — Stress-test with a complex feature.** Test with:

```
Feature: We migrated the authentication system from session-based cookies to JWT tokens. Existing sessions will be invalidated on March 15. Users will need to log in again, and any API integrations using session cookies must be updated to use bearer tokens. The new system supports refresh tokens with a 30-day expiry.
```

This is a breaking change with multiple user impacts. Does the prompt correctly identify type as "breaking_change", set user_action_required to true, and provide useful migration details?

**Step 8 — Stress-test with a minimal change.** Now try a trivial update:

```
Feature: Fixed a typo in the footer — "Contant Us" now correctly reads "Contact Us".
```

Does the prompt handle this gracefully? Does it classify it correctly as a bugfix? Does it avoid inflating a one-word typo into a multi-sentence description?

**Step 9 — Build your validation checklist.** Based on your constraints, write a checklist you could hand to a colleague (or encode in a script) to validate any output:
1. Valid JSON that parses without errors?
2. All required fields present with correct types?
3. Title under 10 words, sentence case, no period?
4. Description exactly 2-3 sentences?
5. affected_areas using only standardized names?
6. details is null when user_action_required is false?

**Step 10 — Reflect.** You've built three versions: loose (Step 1), schema-only (Step 2), and schema + constraints (Step 5). The progression shows three distinct levels of production readiness:
- **Loose**: Human-readable but not machine-parseable — a script can't extract structured fields from prose
- **Schema-only**: Parseable and structured, but with uncontrolled quality variation (inconsistent lengths, vague data, repeated fields)
- **Schema + constraints**: Parseable, structured, AND consistently high quality with enforced rules

Which version could you hand off to a developer to feed into an automated release notes system? That's the bar for "production-ready."

## Lab 4: Multi-Expert & Reverse Prompting (12 minutes)

**Goal**: Use multi-expert prompting to get diverse perspectives on a complex decision, then use reverse prompting to discover hidden requirements.

**What you'll learn**: How simulating multiple expert viewpoints catches blind spots, and how letting the AI ask questions produces better specifications.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Single-perspective baseline.** Paste this prompt:

```
Should our company adopt a 4-day work week? Give your recommendation.
```

Note the response: Does it consider multiple angles or lean toward one perspective?

**Step 2 — Multi-expert panel.** Now simulate a panel of experts:

```
Task: Analyze whether a 200-person software company should adopt a 4-day work week.

Simulate a panel of 4 experts. Each expert must provide their analysis independently:

Expert 1 - HR Director (15 years experience):
Focus on: employee retention, recruitment advantage, burnout, morale
Provide: Assessment + specific risk + specific benefit

Expert 2 - CFO:
Focus on: productivity impact, revenue implications, operational costs, client coverage
Provide: Assessment + financial estimate + key assumption

Expert 3 - Engineering Manager:
Focus on: sprint velocity, code quality, collaboration time, deep work
Provide: Assessment + metric prediction + mitigation strategy

Expert 4 - Employment Lawyer:
Focus on: labor law compliance, contract modifications, overtime implications, precedent cases
Provide: Assessment + top legal risk + required action

After all 4 experts present, provide:
- Points of agreement across experts
- Points of conflict between experts
- A synthesis recommendation with confidence level (low/medium/high)
- The single most important factor the decision hinges on
```

**Step 3 — Compare depth.** Compare the Step 1 and Step 2 responses:
- How many distinct perspectives were covered in each?
- Did the multi-expert version surface risks you hadn't considered?
- Was the synthesis recommendation more nuanced?

**Step 4 — Customize the panel.** Choose a decision relevant to your own work (e.g., adopting a new tool, changing a process, launching a feature). Modify the expert panel to include 3-4 roles relevant to that decision. Run it.

**Step 5 — Transition to reverse prompting.** Now let's flip the script. Instead of you writing the prompt, let the AI ask the questions. Paste:

```
I want to write a prompt that generates a comprehensive project proposal for a software project. But instead of me writing that prompt, I want you to help me discover what the prompt needs.

Ask me a series of clarifying questions — one at a time — to understand:
- What kind of project this is for
- Who will read the proposal
- What sections are required
- What constraints exist
- What level of detail is needed

Ask your first question now. After I answer each question, ask the next one. After 5-6 questions, generate the complete prompt for me.
```

**Step 6 — Answer the AI's questions.** Respond to each question the AI asks. Be as specific or vague as you'd naturally be — this tests whether the AI asks good follow-ups. Go through 5-6 rounds of questions.

**Step 7 — Evaluate the generated prompt.** After the AI generates your prompt, assess it:
- Did it capture details you wouldn't have included on your own?
- Is it more specific than what you would have written from scratch?
- Does it include elements from the 6 building blocks?

**Step 8 — Test the generated prompt.** Take the prompt the AI created and use it in a new conversation. Does the output match what you envisioned?

**Step 9 — Compare approaches.** Think about what each technique revealed:
- Multi-expert: How many distinct risks and perspectives did it surface vs. Step 1's single-perspective answer? Count them.
- Reverse prompting: Did the AI ask you about things you hadn't considered? List 2-3 details the generated prompt included that you wouldn't have thought of on your own.

**Step 10 — Reflect on when to use each.** These techniques solve different problems:
- **Multi-expert** is best when you already know the question but need to stress-test it from multiple angles. Use it for decisions with competing stakeholder interests.
- **Reverse prompting** is best when you don't know what you don't know — when the problem space is unfamiliar or you suspect you're missing requirements.
- **Combined**: In practice, you'd use reverse prompting first (to discover requirements), then feed those into a multi-expert analysis (to stress-test the decision). Write down one real decision at work where this two-step approach would be valuable.

## Lab 5: Optimization & Integration (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Apply probabilistic prompting and incentive framing to maximize quality on a high-stakes task, then build a reusable decision-making template.

**What you'll learn**: How multi-round self-critique and audience framing each independently improve output quality — and how combining them produces the most reliable results.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Baseline decision analysis.** Paste this straightforward prompt:

```
Task: Recommend a database for a new e-commerce application that expects 10,000 daily active users, needs to store product catalogs, user profiles, and order history.

Options: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB

Which should we choose and why?
```

Read the response and note:
- Does it acknowledge trade-offs, or just advocate for one option?
- Does it mention any uncertainty or risks?
- Does it consider what might change in the future?

**Step 2 — Add multi-round self-critique.** Use the exact same task and context, but change the analysis structure:

```
Task: Recommend a database for a new e-commerce application that expects 10,000 daily active users, needs to store product catalogs, user profiles, and order history.

Options: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB

Provide your analysis in 3 rounds:

Round 1 - Initial assessment: Rate each option from 1-10 for fit, with a one-sentence justification for each.

Round 2 - Devil's advocate: For your top-rated option, list the 3 strongest arguments AGAINST choosing it. Re-rate all options after considering these counter-arguments.

Round 3 - Final recommendation: State your recommended choice with a confidence level (0-100%). Explain what would need to be true for your second-choice option to become the better pick.
```

**Step 3 — Compare Step 1 vs. Step 2.** The task and context are identical — the only difference is the multi-round structure. Compare:
- Did the Round 2 devil's advocate surface risks that Step 1 ignored?
- Did the ratings change between Round 1 and Round 2? (If so, the self-critique actually worked.)
- Did the confidence percentage help you gauge how certain the recommendation really is?
- Did the "what would need to be true" condition give you a concrete revisit trigger?

This is the value of **probabilistic prompting**: forcing the model to argue against its own first instinct.

**Step 4 — Isolate the effect of incentive framing.** Now take your Step 2 prompt and add ONLY an audience frame at the top. Keep everything else identical:

```
This analysis will be presented to the CTO and VP of Engineering for a final architecture decision. The chosen database will serve as our primary data store for the next 3-5 years, so accuracy and completeness are critical.

Take your time and be thorough. Consider edge cases and failure modes that are easy to overlook.

Task: Recommend a database for a new e-commerce application that expects 10,000 daily active users, needs to store product catalogs, user profiles, and order history.

Options: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB

Provide your analysis in 3 rounds:

Round 1 - Initial assessment: Rate each option from 1-10 for fit, with a one-sentence justification for each.

Round 2 - Devil's advocate: For your top-rated option, list the 3 strongest arguments AGAINST choosing it. Re-rate all options after considering these counter-arguments.

Round 3 - Final recommendation: State your recommended choice with a confidence level (0-100%). Explain what would need to be true for your second-choice option to become the better pick.
```

**Step 5 — Compare Step 2 vs. Step 4.** The ONLY change was adding the incentive frame. Look for:
- Are the justifications longer or more detailed?
- Did it mention additional risk factors or edge cases?
- Is the language more precise (specific numbers, concrete scenarios vs. vague generalities)?
- Did the confidence percentage change?

This isolates the effect of **incentive framing** — telling the model who the audience is and that the stakes are high.

**Step 6 — Build your reusable template.** Now combine everything that worked into a general-purpose decision template:

```
[INCENTIVE FRAME]
This analysis will inform a critical decision for [stakeholder].
Accuracy and completeness are essential. Take your time.

[CONTEXT]
Decision: [What we're deciding]
Options: [Option A, Option B, Option C]
Current situation: [Key constraints and requirements]
Timeline: [When decision is needed and implementation horizon]

[MULTI-ROUND ANALYSIS]
Round 1: Rate each option (1-10) with one-line justification.
Round 2: For the top option, list 3 strongest counter-arguments. Re-rate.
Round 3: Final recommendation with:
- Confidence level (0-100%)
- Biggest risk of recommended option
- What would change your recommendation
- Revisit trigger for 6-month check-in

[FORMAT]
Present as structured sections with clear headers.
Keep total response under 500 words.
```

**Step 7 — Test your template on a real decision.** Apply your template to a decision you're actually facing — choosing a tool, vendor, approach, or process change. Fill in the brackets and run it. Does the output feel decision-ready?

**Step 8 — Final reflection.** Across all five labs, you've built a toolkit:
- Lab 1: The 6 building blocks for constructing any prompt
- Lab 2: Few-shot and CoT for accuracy on nuanced tasks
- Lab 3: Structured outputs + constraints for production systems
- Lab 4: Multi-expert and reverse prompting for complex decisions
- Lab 5: Self-critique + incentive framing for high-stakes quality

Write down the one technique you'll use first thing tomorrow — and what task you'll apply it to.
